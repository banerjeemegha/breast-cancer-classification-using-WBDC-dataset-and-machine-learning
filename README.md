# breast-cancer-classification-using-WBDC-dataset-and-machine-learning
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers are used to develop a machine learning (ML) model using the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer (WDBC) dataset, so as to assess the characteristics of a breast cancer formation at early stages and classify it as benign or malignant. In the proposed scheme, feature selection and feature extraction are done to extract statistical features from the dataset and comparison between the models is provided based on their performance to identify the most suitable approach for diagnosis. The dataset apportioned into various arrangements of train-test split. The presentation of the framework is estimated, depending on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and recall. The binary classification problem achieved a maximum accuracy of 98.55%. Paper accepted at IEEE conference.
